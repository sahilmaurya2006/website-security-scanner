## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### Questions You'll Be Asked

**"Tell me about this project"**
> "This is a full-stack security scanning application. The backend analyzes websites for security misconfigurations, checking 8 critical security headers and calculating a dynamic score. The frontend is a responsive React app with a professional dark theme. It demonstrates full-stack development, cybersecurity knowledge, and attention to code quality."

**"How does the security scoring work?"**
> "It's a weighted system: HTTPS gets 20 points, CSP gets 20 points, and so on, totaling 100. Each check is independent, and the final score is capped between 0-100. Sites without HTTPS get a penalty. The system prioritizes the most critical vulnerabilities."

**"What would you add next?"**
> "I'd add a database for persistence, implement user authentication, and add email notifications for scheduled scans. I'd also add more advanced checks like SSL certificate analysis and dependency vulnerability scanning."

**"Why is this important?"**
> "Many websites have security misconfigurations that expose users to attacks. This tool helps developers quickly identify these issues and fix them. It demonstrates both security awareness and development capability."
